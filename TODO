# TODO Before Finishing Branch

This branch tracks the removal of a pre-created laravel install, and consequently, the creation of a shell script to detect 
if laravel is installed, and if not, run the install.

The following steps are required to be done before a merge is possible:

 * Setup env var to specify laravel version - for easy change in the version to be installed
 * Set up an option to allow dropping in an existing app instead of just a new one (aka - env var to stop all the install work)
 * Generate App Key
 * Either create a golden env file, or minipulate the autogenerated one
 * Setup handling for redis, mail, broadcasts, queue and sessions, to all work as expected. This will likely involve changing defaults in www/app/config/*
 * Create specific handling for both the latest laravel as well as the LTS. Should support: 5.5 (LTS), 5.6, and 5.7.
 * Switch to swarm for better secrets handling among other things
 * TEST!
