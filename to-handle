Permissions (uuid) in containers (manage centrally - do more reading - updates permissions by UID/GID env vars.

Composer install problem on first run - need to bootstrap somehow, but while still keeping container prod ready (maybe that's not an issue
  startup script created - fixed

Maybe add env var to http container to bootstrap (reset permissions, run composer and artisan commands)
  done

Install composer in http container

final debugging
