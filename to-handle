Permissions (uuid) in containers (manage centrally - do more reading - updates permissions by UID/GID env vars.

Composer install problem on first run - need to bootstrap somehow, but while still keeping container prod ready (maybe that's not an issue
  startup script created - fixed

Maybe add env var to http container to bootstrap (reset permissions, run composer and artisan commands)
  done

Install composer in http container

Compose does not use swarm mode to deploy services to multiple nodes in a swarm. All containers will be scheduled on the current node.

To deploy your application across the swarm, use `docker stack deploy`.
